**Project Title**

<h5> Algorithmic Trading in Forex: Machine Learning Approaches for GBP/EUR Profitability.</h5>

**Project Overview** 

<h6> Forex trading involves the exchange of currency pairs, aiming to profit from changes in exchange rates. Algorithmic trading leverages computer programs to execute trades based on predefined rules, often informed by historical data and predictive models. This project focuses on creating and assessing algorithmic trading strategies for the GBP/EUR currency pair. It will utilize machine learning models such as Gated Recurrent Unit(GRU), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Gaussian Processg to predict market trends and improve trading outcomes. The strategies will be evaluated through backtesting on historical data and compared against baseline trading strategies to assess their profitability and robustness. This exploration aims to provide valuable insights into the efficacy of machine learning in developing profitable forex trading strategies.</h6>

**Data Overview**

<h6> The dataset used in this project consists of 5402 records of historical GBP/EUR forex data spanning over 20 years. It includes the following columns: Date, Open, Close, Low, High, Adjacent Close, and Volume prices. The data has been ethically sourced from Yahoo Finance and preprocessed to ensure quality and accuracy. The dataset has been thoroughly checked to ensure GDPR compliance.</h6>

**Dependencies**

<h6>Install or use any Python IDE preferably Google Colab.</h6>

<h6>Install any required Python library packages for EDA, Model Development, and Performance Evaluation, preferably using pip, pip install -r requirements.txt</h6>

**How to Use the Project**

<h6> Data Analysis: Use the Google Colab in the notebooks directory to explore the data and identify trends.</h6>
<h6> Model Development: Modify and run the model training script to develop and compare different machine-learning models.</h6>
<h6> Strategy Creation: Utilize the predictions from the trained models and combine them with technical indicators to create trading strategies.</h6>
<h6> Backtesting and Optimization: Use the evaluation script to backtest the strategies on historical data and optimize their performance.</h6>
<h6> Trading Execution: Identify the best-performing strategy, you can use it to inform your trading decisions in a live environment.</h6>
